Send your current home IP to your EMAIL (**NO Dynamic DNS or Business ISP Plan needed**)

Simply spin your Raspberry-Pi for this or any linux running 24x7 in your home/lab.

Script sends email if there is change in IP. You can run script using Cron job every hour or 4 hours (as most of DHCP leases are for 8 hours)

Script can be used for VPN purpose if you don't have Dynamic DNS or Business ISP Plan. _Even I believe **INTERNET** should be completelty **FREE** Haha!_ 

**Cron:**
